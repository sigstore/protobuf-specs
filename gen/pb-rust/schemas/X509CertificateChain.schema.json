Verifiers MUST validate the chain carefully to ensure that it chains up to a root CA certificate that they trust, regardless of whether the chain includes additional intermediate/root CA certificates. Verifiers MAY enforce additional constraints, such as requiring that all intermediate CA certificates appear in an independent root of trust. Verifiers SHOULD handle old or non-complying bundles that have additional intermediate/root CA certificates."
