            "description": "The checkpoint MUST contain an origin string as a unique log identifier, the tree size, and the root hash. It MAY also be followed by optional data, and clients MUST NOT assume optional data. The checkpoint MUST also contain a signature over the root hash (tree head). The checkpoint MAY contain additional signatures, but the first SHOULD be the signature from the log. Checkpoint contents are concatenated with newlines into a single string. The checkpoint format is described in https://github.com/transparency-dev/formats/blob/main/log/README.md and https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-checkpoint.md. An example implementation can be found in https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/pkg/util/signed_note.go"
